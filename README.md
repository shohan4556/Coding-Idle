The original beta can be found here [original game](http://www.kongregate.com/games/programmernation/coding-idle-recoded-beta)

# Goal
The current goal of this project is to replicate the current beta version into a stable unity c# project. We have the source code on our server but we prefer not to use anything from the original game instead we are trying to look at the game and code the functionality from scratch

Contributions are welcome and encouraged as it is gonna be quite a while before the game is up and running

# TODO
- See issues for todo list and current goals
